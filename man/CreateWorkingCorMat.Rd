\title{Create a Working Correlation Matrix for a Single Cluster}
\usage{
CreateWorkingCorMat(
  n_subj_per_period,
  n_obs_periods,
  sample_type,
  within_period_cor,
  between_period_cor = NULL,
  within_subject_cor = NULL,
  cor_decay_rate = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_subj_per_period}{Integer. The number of subjects per observed period in a cluster.}

\item{n_obs_periods}{Integer. The number of observed time periods.}

\item{sample_type}{Character. Specifies the type of sample design: "cohort" or "cross-sectional".}

\item{within_period_cor}{Numeric. Correlation between observations on different subjects in the same cluster and time period.}

\item{between_period_cor}{Numeric. Correlation between observations on different subjects in the same cluster but different time periods. Optional.}

\item{within_subject_cor}{Numeric. Correlation between observations on the same subject at different time periods. Optional.}

\item{cor_decay_rate}{Numeric. The rate at which correlation decays over time. Optional.}
}
\value{
A square matrix of dimension \((n\_subj\_per\_period \times n\_obs\_periods)\) specifying the working correlation structure between observations in the same cluster over time.
}
\description{
This function generates a working correlation matrix based on different correlation structures,
such as exponential decay, nested exchangeable, proportional decay, and block exchangeable.
The function is intended for use as a utility function to specify correlation structures
for GEE-based power calculations or sample size calculations in stepped-wedge trials.
